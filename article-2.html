    <h1>Spiritual Worship</h1>

    <p class="verse">
      Psalm 96:9 says, “Worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness; tremble before him, all the earth.”
    </p>

    <p>
      What does worship mean in the Bible? In the above verse, the original word for “worship” means to bow down, and in the English language “worship” refers to reverence and submission.
    </p>

    <p>
      How can one effectively, and through the Holy Spirit, bow down to our Lord and revere and submit to Him? How can we stay away from worshipping anyone or anything else?
    </p>

    <p>
      Lord Jesus said that the entire law is summed up in just two commandments: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.” Worship is surely related to the first commandment. Elsewhere in the Bible it says, “Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Worship, or bowing down to the Lord, is the product of love and fear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Worshipping someone or something is setting them at higher standards and admiring them. For example, blindly following a competent human leader will lead a person to admire his or her capabilities, and trust will begin to form. Obeying a leader or following orders is the right thing to do in many situations, but when there is a nudging in your conscience that a certain action or decision is not right or immoral, and yet you choose to submit to the leadership, accepting they know better, it becomes an act of worship. In this case, you idolize the leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another example would be submitting to fleshly desires, including ambitions. If your life involves proving yourself to people—that you are wise, capable, and can accomplish things—no matter how noble that work may seem, you idolize the work above God and worship it. It is very important to understand who or what we admire the most and keep only God at the highest standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any new Christian will confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe God alone is to be worshipped. In this rat race of the fleshly world, one can easily flip, either intentionally or unintentionally, into worshipping other things, including money, honor, ambitions, entertainment, and lust. These things can seem so valuable that they can lead someone to question what else there is in life. But God says these are worthless, which means every step in that direction is a walk toward death.

      Philippians 3:8 — “What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage
