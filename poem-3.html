    <h1 class="poem-title">Fire of my heart</h1>

    <pre class="poem-text">In the course of a human sail,
Numerous choices unfold to spin a tale.
Lure of lies seems so right,
Wise men and frail fall alike, and myself no surprise.
Lost and left alone in what could have been a paradise.

Engulfed in the fog of panic and fear,
I glimpse inside myself a tiny but a radiant fire.
In all my meaningless wander and struggle so long,
Wonder how this fire of heart was never put down.
A secure flame that was always on all along.

Humbled by the amazing power,
To the everlasting fire I heed and adhere.
A tingling of hope surges within and a new marching begins,
With a grieving admittance of the overwhelming distance.

With every step I took the hope got strong,
And the flame of my soul is always on.
Like the sudden flash of a thunder in the night,
Voila! To the halcyon city I arrive.

Celebrations erupt all over and light up even the darkest sky,
Yet gratitude takes over and I bow to the flame that flies so high.
Soon did I realize this is not the end,
And a great new adventure now led by the flame began.</pre>
