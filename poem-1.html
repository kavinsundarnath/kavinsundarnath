      <h3 class="poem-title">DISCERNMENT</h3>

      <pre class="poem-text">A searching soul longs for peace,
Hurting inside and smiling outside, worries without cease
In the race with time, we understand life only in part,
And the brightest minds fail to satiate a thirsty heart.
Where then is hope? What is the worth of a human soul?
Perhaps it’s time to closely look at the foundations you hold.

The unique gift of choice is bestowed on us for a purpose,
Heeding to deceptive feelings can drive an individual into darkness.
Hardened clay cannot be shaped nor a blind pride can be saved,
Yet a loving God is not swayed and provides a path that doesn’t fade.
Many obstacles and appealing untruths hop in to hinder the journey,
A careful judgement can avoid the agony.

Selfish worldly ambitions are valid if life ticks to rust,
But would Christ have taken the cross if man is a mere dust?
As John 3:16 put it,
<strong>For God so loved the world that he gave his only son,
that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</strong>
Maybe just be maybe life is special and is meant to thrive.

What you hold dear to your heart defines who you are,
A yoke that is self-centered can leave a scar.
A misplaced trust is revealed with time,
Leading to misery and a wake-up call to heed the signs.
Test and find the working design!

The path to the promised land can be lonely,
But the compassion from God embraces us closely.
These are the words of the living God in Joshua 1:5,
<strong>I will be with you. I will not leave you or forsake you.</strong>
Comforting words that enables a heart to sail through.</pre>
